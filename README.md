# Talking Chat

This project is a job interview challenge to test someone's knowledge of JavaScript, React JS and Node.js.

The project consists of a chat where you should be able to create and enter existing chat rooms and send and receive messages on then.
All the rooms are public to be seen but you have to be registered if you want to send a message.

This project was made using React JS and Node.JS.
